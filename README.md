# PPOL 6805 / DSAN 6750 Final Project: Quarto Manuscript Template

1. Click the **"Use this template"** button in the upper-right, and select **"Create a new repository"**
2. Once the new GitHub repository is created under your account, click the **"Settings"** tab at the top of the repo's GitHub page, then click **"Pages"** in the sidebar on the left of the settings panel
3. Under the **"Branch"** heading, click the dropdown that currently contains "None", and select **main** as the branch where GitHub Pages will serve files from
4. Instead of "/ (root)" (the default option), select **"/docs"** as the directory from which GitHub Pages should serve files from
5. Click **"Save"**
6. Check **"Enforce HTTPS"** (optional, but good to do)
7. Note the **URL** that the page should now show you (it should be something like `your_username.github.io/gis-manuscript`): this is where your manuscript will be rendered to each time you push to the repository! You can change it by changing the name of your repository.
8. Now that GH Pages is set up, you can **clone** your newly-created repository into a directory on your computer
9. Add stuff to the Quarto Manuscript using VSCode
10. Use the terminal/PowerShell commands `git add -A .` then `git commit -m "Your commit message here"`, then `git push` to push the changes you made in Step 10 to GitHub
11. After ~1 min of processing time, the URL that you noted in Step 8 should update to display the newest contents of your Quarto manuscript!
